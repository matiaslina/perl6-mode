Raku mode lets you edit Raku code with [GNU Emacs][] 24.

This mode needs GNU Emacs 24.4.

## Features

* Basic syntax highlighting
* Basic indentation
* Identifier index menu (variables, subs, classes, etc.)
* REPL interaction

#### Planned

* Complete syntax highlighting
* Better indentation support (uses Emacs SMIE grammar, see the Emacs manual)
* Help system
* ETags support
* `find-file-at-point` for module names
* Electricity (`electric-pair-mode` needs some context-sensitive help)
* Unicode character map

#### Not planned

* Syntax checking (use [flycheck-perl6][])

## Installation

With [`use-package`][use-package] in your init file:

```el
(use-package raku-mode
  :ensure t
  :defer t)
```

Or in your [`Cask`][cask] file:

```el
(source melpa)

(depends-on "raku-mode")
```
Or manually from [MELPA][] with <kbd>M-x package-refresh-contents</kbd>
and <kbd>M-x package-install RET raku-mode</kbd>.

## Usage

Just visit Raku files.

The major mode will be autoloaded whenever a Raku file is visited.
This includes any file with `raku` in the shebang, as well as any file
with a `.p6`, `.pm6`, or `.pl6` extension. It also applies to any `.pm`,
`.pl`, and `.t` files whose first line of code looks like Raku.

Start the REPL with <kbd>M-x run-raku RET</kbd>. The following
keybindings are available to interact with the REPL:

* <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>: Send the current line to the REPL
* <kbd>C-c C-r</kbd>: Send the selected region to the REPL
* <kbd>C-c C-h</kbd>: Send the whole buffer to the REPL

The REPL will start if needed with this keybindings.

Use <kbd>M-x customize-group RET raku</kbd> to customize Raku Mode.

## Contribute

Pull requests are welcome.

You might want to install [`cask`][cask] so you can run the test suite
(with `make test`).
